## Framing Materials

### Aluminum

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Frames from t-slotted extrusions are simple to design and assemble.
- [x] Can be cut to length from stock.
- [x] Can be ordered with pre-drilled and tapped holes or other modifications.
- [ ] Acts as a heat sink (high thermal conductivity & very high specific heat capacity).
- [ ] CNC work beyond basic cuts is expensive.
</div>

<!-- ### Plastics -->

### Steel

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Inexpensive & readily available.
- [x] Can be cut and machined from stock extrusions.
- [ ] Heavier than aluminum or wood.
- [ ] Harder to machine and fabricate than aluminum.
- [ ] Requires protection against oxidation.
- [ ] CNC work beyond basic cuts is expensive.
</div>

### Wood

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Generally inexpensive.
- [x] Tools are common, cheap to purchase or easy to borrow.
- [ ] Quality varies.
- [ ] Can be expensive if sourcing specific materials.
- [ ] Wood suitable for framing is heavy.

## Exterior Panels

### Aluminum

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Generally inexpensive to source.
- [x] Can be purchased as sheets.
- [x] Easy to drill.
- [ ] CNC work beyond basic cuts becomes expensive.
</div>

### ACM Panels

*TODO: Complete*

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Can be purchased as sheets.
- [x] Excellent insulator from radiant heat.
- [ ] Expensive
</div>
