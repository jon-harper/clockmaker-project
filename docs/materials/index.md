## Framing Materials

### Aluminum

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Frames from t-slotted extrusions are simple to design and assemble.
- [x] Can be cut to length from stock.
- [x] Can be ordered with pre-drilled and tapped holes or other modifications.
- [ ] CNC work beyond basic cuts is expensive.
</div>

<!-- ### Plastics -->

### Steel

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Inexpensive.
- [ ] Heavier than aluminum or wood.
- [ ] Requires more work than t-slot to use.
- [ ] Requires protection against oxidation.
</div>

### Wood

<div class="jh-proconlist" markdown>
- [x] Generally inexpensive.
- [x] Tools are common, cheap to purchase or easy to borrow.
