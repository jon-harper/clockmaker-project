Compared to the familiar PLA and PETG, engineering plastics are harder to print, less tolerant of mistakes, typically require an enclosure, and sometimes need high ambient temperatures.

Most 3D printers are not sold enclosed and require modification to operate in an enclosure. Electronics do not tolerate high ambient heat, and even a basic enclosure can reach 45C/113F.

The solution is either to extend or replace the printer's existing wiring harness. This is a time-consuming and meticulous task to do *safely*.

## The Clockmaker Project

Enter The Clockmaker Project. More toolbox than blueprint, this project collects information about on how to build an enclosed printer:

- Air filtration and Ventilation
- Temperature monitoring
- Wiring
- Insulation
