Compared to the familiar PLA and PETG, engineering plastics are harder to print, less tolerant of mistakes, typically require an enclosure, and sometimes need high ambient temperatures.

Most 3D printers are not sold enclosed and require modification to operate within one. Electronics are not usually tolerant of high heat, and even a basic enclosure can reach 45C/113F.

The solution is to extend or replace the printer's existing wiring harness. This is a time-consuming and meticulous task to do *safely*. (TODO: more on enclosure and fire safety.)

## The Clockmaker Project

Enter The Clockmaker Project. More toolbox than blueprint, this project collects information about on how to build an enclosed printer:

- Air filtration and Ventilation
- Temperature monitoring
- Wiring
- Insulation
- Links to outside resources

Additionally, the associated git repository has printable files to help build your own enclosure.
