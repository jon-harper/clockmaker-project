Most are commonly encountered when working with 3D printers; some may only be of interest if fabricating a wiring harness. Basic Considerations Electrical properties Ampacity Resistance Temperature rise & operating temperature Physical properties Mating force Locking/latching method Uses (board, free hanging, panel mount) Pin sizes/compatible wire gauges Overall connector size Other Considerations Cost Availability Note Most entries contain a line labeled \"application\". This will be at least one of three values: Board Free hanging Panel mount Board connectors have one connector design for a board and mating connector for the wire. Free hanging connectors mate two two cables together. Panel mount connectors are a type of free hanging connector that can also be attached to a panel (usually by snapping in place with a pair of \"ears\"). Pin and Socket Connectors Harwin M20 / \"DuPont\" These are very simple, common connectors for bare 0.1\" headers. They are not latching or locking and should be avoided (or used with hot glue for retention) Why are they called DuPont connectors? Why are they so hard to crimp? Specifications Pitch: 2.54mm Max Current Rating: 3A Wire Gauges: AWG #22-#30 Applications: board only Available Positions: Single Row: 2-12 position Dual Row: 4-24 position Pros and Cons Mates easily with headers. Good for temporary connections. No latch or lock mechanism. Can be difficult to crimp. Links Datasheet Assorted Single Row Kit JST PH These have wide application as a compact connector for PCBs when space is at a premium. NEMA 17 steppers often use this connector. The small pitch can make these difficult to crimp. Specifications Pitch: 2.0mm Current Rating: 2.0A / #24 AWG Wire Gauges: #24 - #32 AWG Applications: board only Available Positions: Single Row: 2-16 Pros and Cons Inexpensive Very compact Low mating cycle rating Can be difficult to crimp Links Datasheet 2-6 Position Kit JST RCY These are sometimes called JST SYP, though JST lists the product as RCY series. RCY connectors are used in 3D printing to extend wire pairs (or make them disconnectable) as an inline alternative to XH or PH connectors. RCY are also physically smaller in size than SM. Specifications Pitch: 2.5mm Max Current Rating: 3.0A / AWG #22 (2.0A / AWG #24) Wire Gauges: AWG #22-#28 Applications: inline only Available Positions: 2 Common uses: remote-controlled cars and airplanes. Notes: usually red or black. Sometimes found in 2.54mm pitch. Pros and Cons Inexpensive Useful for splicing Low mating cycle rating 2-position only Links Datasheet 2 Position Kit JST SH This connector is most familiar to BLTouch users with the 5-position female connector. The 4-position female SH connector is used for the SparkFun Qwiic and Adafruit Stemma QT interconnects for I2C. Specifications Pitch: 1.0mm Current Rating: 1.0A Wire Gauges: AWG #28-#32 Applications: board only Available Positions: Single Row: 2-15, 20 Pros and Cons Extremely compact Nearly impossible to crimp at home Links Datasheet 5 Position Kit JST SM Although these connectors are only for wire-to-wire connections, they are easy to crimp and can be panel mounted. A downside to SM connectors is the size of the shell. Specifications Pitch: 2.5mm Max Current Rating: 3.0A / AWG #22 Wire Gauges: AWG #22 - #28 Applications: free hanging, panel mount Available Positions: Single Row: 2-12 position Dual Row: 18 position Common uses: RGB LED light strips Notes: found in a wide variety of colors, most commonly white or ivory. Pros and Cons Easy to crimp Simple, large latching mechanism Panel mounts Bulky connector housing Pins are mechanically weak and prone to bending Not rated for frequent disconnection Links Datasheet 2-5 Position Kit 2-9 Position Kit JST XH This is the most common connector for 3D printers (e.g., most board-side connectors & limit switches) Specifications Pitch: 2.5mm Current Rating: 3.0A / AWG #22 Wire Gauges: AWG #22 - #30 Applications: board only Available Positions: Single Row: 2-16 position & 20 position Pros and Cons Easy to crimp larger gauges Very common and inexpensive Not rated for more than a few mating cycles Difficult to crimp smaller gauge wires Links Datasheet 2-5 Position Kit Molex Micro Fit 3.0 Perfect but for the price. Found on 3D printers, particularly as hotend connectors. Specifications Pitch: 3.0mm Max Current Rating: up to 8.5A Wire Gauges: AWG #18 - #24, #26 - #30 (two pin sizes) Applications: board, free hanging, panel mount Available Positions: Single Row: 2-11 position Dual Row: 2-24 position Pros and Cons Easy to crimp Reliable latching mechanism Board, inline, and panel mounted Relatively high current rating High temperature rating Expensive Can be hard to source Connectors larger than 16 position are hard to remove Links Datasheet 2-6 Position Kit Molex Mini Fit Jr This is the familiar ATX connector used in computers for motherboard and video card power. This connector may have application for heated beds (using two or more parallel circuits). Specifications Pitch: 4.2mm Max Current Rating: 9A Wire Gauges: AWG #18 - #24, #24 - #28 (two pin sizes) Applications: board, free hanging, panel mount Available Positions: Single Row: 2-6 position Dual Row: 2-24 position Pros and Cons Large, reliable latch Panel mounts Large connector housing Expensive Can be hard to source Links Datasheet Dual Row 2-20 Position Kit XT60 Unlike most pin and socket connectors in this list, wires are soldered in place for XT60 connectors. These are an inexpensive solution for high current applications (such as powering a heated bed). Specifications Max Current Rating: 30A (60A instantaneous) Wire Gauges: AWG #12 Applications: free hanging, panel mount Available Positions: 2 position Common uses: RC car batteries Pros and Cons Inexpensive High current rating Panel mounts Requires soldering Links Datasheet SparkFun Connector Pair Closed Barrel Connectors These connectors are often used in automotive and marine applications. Their current-carrying capacity is dependant on the size of the surface contact area. The larger the mating contact, the more current that can be safely carried. Avoid uninsulated terminals; fully insulated marine terminals are best for 3D printing applications. Generally speaking, closed barrel connectors do not use pins and thus are single-conductor connections. Common Examples TODO: Expand Ring Fork Spade Bullet Ferrules Other Connectors Aviation TODO: Expand DSUB TODO: Expand Low-Voltage, Low-Current Connectors IDC Ribbon IDC stands for insulation-displacement contact. These are meant for low-voltage, low-current applications, particularly digital signaling. They are most frequently found on LCD 3D printer displays. These connectors are not meant for frequent mating and removal. They should be avoided where possible. RJ-45 RJ-45 is the specification for the connector that terminates Ethernet cables, often generically referred to as Cat5 or Cat6 cables.

We use this palette throughout, along with the following abbreviations: Color Abbreviation Black K Blue B Green G Red R White W Yellow Y Secondary Colors Most pin types will have the same wire color: analog signals are yellow, PWM pins are green. GND and VIN are black and red, respectively. To help balance the lengths of color used in a harness, some pins list a secondary color. 3.3-volt and 5-volt VIN pins have blue as a secondary color where enough colors are available. GND pins that are drains for analog signal pins have white as a secondary color. Considerations Wire Gauges If you do not regularly work with hookup wire, up-gauging to AWG #24 for any smaller gauge is an option to reduce sourcing costs. Pros & Cons Saves by buying more of one type of wire. Larger wires can be easier to work with. Reduce number of pins types for some connectors (e.g., Molex Mini Fit family) Increases thickness of wire bundle. Can significantly increase weight of toolhead bundle. Panel Mount Connector Patterns There are two ways of designing of a wiring panel. This guide starts with a one-to-one pattern, then uses this build larger cable segments in a one-to-many pattern. One-to-One Panels Each component of the printer has an individual connector on the panel. These are point-to-point, single component connectors. Pros & Cons Simple to design: cables are point-to-point. Cables can be replaced easily. Large number of connectors to connect & disconnect. Messy wire bundles. Significant slack must be left before wrapping bundle. One-to-Many Panels Grouping components into one connector greatly reduces the nubmer of cables and simplifies servicing. A one-to-many panel mount connects multiple components. From the panel, the cable may branch further. Pros & Cons Easier to mate and disconnect. Cheaper/fewer connectors to source. Compact panels. Tight wiring harnesses. Complex to design and assemble. Unforgiving of mistakes. Difficult or impossible to repair connectors with large numbers of pins.
